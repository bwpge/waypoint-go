# This is a sample waypoint configuration file. Each KEY will map to an endpoint
# on the backend to /KEY. The object is expected to have the following form:
#
# KEY:
#   url: <string>
#   redir: <bool>
#   alias:
#     - <string>
#     - ...
#
# If `redir` is false (or ommitted), the content of the page will be returned
# with a GET request. If `redir` is true, the request will be redirected with a
# 302 response and the url verbatim as it appears in the config.
#
# Example:
#
#   foo:
#     url: http://foo.bar/baz
#     redir: true
#     alias:
#       - foo1
#       - foo2
