# Each item will map to an endpoint on the backend at /KEY. The item object is
# expected to have the following form:
#
# KEY:
#   content: <string>
#   url: <string>
#   redir: <bool>
#   alias:
#     - <string>
#     - ...
#
# Only content or url is required (content takes priority over url).
#
# If `redir` is false (or ommitted), the content of the url will be returned
# with a GET request. If `redir` is true, the request will be redirected with
# a 302 response and the url verbatim as it appears in the config.
